# Freivald-Rust

A starter implementation for Freivald's algorithm over `ark_bls12_381::Fr`.

The point is to illustrate Freivaldsâ€™ algorithm does save runtime compared to the best known deterministic algorithm.

### Get Started
Implement the `unimplemented!` block, then run:

```rust
cargo test
cargo bench
```
