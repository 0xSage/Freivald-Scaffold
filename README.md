# Freivald-Rust

An unsafe, Rust implementation of Freivald's algorithm on matrix multiplication verification.
It does not panic at overflows, and merely continues execution.

The point is to benchmark Freivaldsâ€™ algorithm does save runtime compared to the best known deterministic algorithm.

### Get Started
Implement the `unimplemented!` block, then run:

```rust
cargo test
cargo bench
```
